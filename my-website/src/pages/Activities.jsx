                    <p>On March 30, 2024, the Boys' Club embarked on an exciting visit to the
                        Canadian Aviation Museum in Windsor, Ontario. The trip offered a fantastic
                        blend of education and adventure, sparking the boysâ€™ interest in aviation history
                        and technology.</p>
                    <p>
                        Our journey began with a warm welcome from the museum staff, who provided
                        an engaging overview of the museum's exhibits. The boys were thrilled to see
                        an impressive collection of historical aircraft, including the iconic Avro Lancaster
                        bomber and the de Havilland Mosquito. The hands-on exhibits allowed the boys
                        to climb into cockpits and experience the thrill of piloting vintage aircraft.

                        One of the highlights was a special guided tour by the Museum Vice President,
                        Mr. John Robinson, who shared captivating stories about the planes and their
                        roles in Canadian aviation history. The boys also watched several volunteer
                        technicians who give time to restore aircraft at the museum do their work. They
                        hopefully will take in this example of service to our community.
